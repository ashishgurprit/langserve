## Accessibility & Cultural Color

**Critical:** Color blindness affects 1 in 12 men (8%), 1 in 200 women (0.5%)

**Types:**
- **Deuteranopia** (most common): Red-green confusion
- **Protanopia:** Red-green (different from above)
- **Tritanopia:** Blue-yellow confusion

**Solutions:**
- Never rely on color alone (use icons, text labels, patterns)
- Test with simulators (Stark plugin for Figma, Color Oracle)
- Use high contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1, AAA: 7:1)
- Avoid red/green as only differentiators (traffic lights also use position + shape)

## Research Resources

**Before Finalizing Color Palette:**
1. **Google:** "[Country] color symbolism"
2. **Academic:** "Color Psychology in [Culture]" (JSTOR, Google Scholar)
3. **Local Consultants:** Hire native designers for review
4. **Test:** User testing with target demographic (not assumptions)

**Tools:**
- [Color Culture Report](https://www.colourlovers.com/) - Community insights
- [Global Color Survey](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/) - XKCD's massive survey
- Local market research (Pew Research, regional studies)

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, test with the actual audience. Cultural color psychology is a guideline, not a law. Individual preferences, modern globalization, and context always matter more than generalizations.
