# Landing Page Conversion Checklist

## Pre-Launch Checklist (50+ Items)

Use this checklist before launching ANY landing page to maximize conversion rate.

---

## Section 1: Above-the-Fold (Critical)

### Headline

- [ ] **Benefit-driven** (what they get, not what you do)
- [ ] **Specific** (includes numbers, timeframes, or concrete outcomes)
- [ ] **Under 12 words** (readable in 3 seconds)
- [ ] **Immediately understandable** (no jargon, no ambiguity)
- [ ] **Matches ad/email copy** (if traffic is coming from campaigns)
- [ ] **Addresses target audience** (speaks to their needs)

**Test**: Can a 12-year-old understand the value in 3 seconds?

---

### Subheadline

- [ ] **Supports headline** (adds detail or handles objection)
- [ ] **Under 25 words** (one sentence max)
- [ ] **Includes qualifier** (e.g., "No code required" handles tech objection)
- [ ] **Not redundant** (doesn't repeat headline verbatim)

---

### Primary CTA Button

- [ ] **Action-oriented** (starts with verb: Start, Get, See)
- [ ] **Benefit-included** (e.g., "Start Free Trial" not just "Submit")
- [ ] **First-person** ("Start My Trial" beats "Start Your Trial" by 90%)
- [ ] **High contrast** (stands out from background)
- [ ] **Large enough** (minimum 200×50px, 44×44px for mobile)
- [ ] **Above the fold** (visible without scrolling)
- [ ] **White space around it** (draws eye naturally)
- [ ] **No competing CTAs** (one primary action above fold)

---

### Hero Image/Video

- [ ] **Shows product in use** (not abstract stock photos)
- [ ] **High quality** (not blurry, pixelated, or amateur)
- [ ] **Optimized for speed** (< 500KB for images, lazy load for video)
- [ ] **Includes faces** (humans connect with humans)
- [ ] **Relevant to audience** (they can see themselves in it)
- [ ] **Has alt text** (for accessibility + SEO)

---

### Trust Signals

- [ ] **Customer count visible** (e.g., "Trusted by 12,000+ companies")
- [ ] **Ratings/reviews** (e.g., "4.9/5 stars on G2")
- [ ] **Recognizable logos** (5-10 brand logos if B2B)
- [ ] **Security badges** (SSL, GDPR, SOC 2 if applicable)
- [ ] **Placed near CTA** (builds trust before action)

---

## Section 2: Social Proof

### Testimonials

- [ ] **Specific results** (not generic praise like "Great product!")
- [ ] **Includes photo** (95% more credible than text alone)
- [ ] **Full name + title + company** (not just initials)
- [ ] **3-5 testimonials** (more = decision fatigue)
- [ ] **Strategically placed** (after benefits, before pricing)
- [ ] **Diverse** (different industries, company sizes, use cases)

**Bad**: "Amazing product! - J.D."

## Conversion Rate Benchmarks

| **SaaS** | 2-5% | 7-10% | 12%+ |
| **E-commerce** | 1-3% | 3-5% | 5%+ |
| **Agency** | 3-5% | 7-10% | 12%+ |

**Note**: Conversion rate = (Conversions ÷ Visitors) × 100

---

## Red Flags (Fix Immediately)

🚨 **Bounce rate > 70%**: Headline/value prop mismatch with traffic source
🚨 **Avg time on page < 30 seconds**: Not engaging, not clear, or wrong audience
🚨 **Load time > 5 seconds**: Losing 50%+ of visitors before page loads
🚨 **Mobile conversion << Desktop**: Mobile experience is broken
🚨 **Form abandonment > 70%**: Form too long or confusing

**Remember**: A landing page is never "done." Launch, measure, test, improve. Repeat. The best-converting pages are iterated 20+ times.
