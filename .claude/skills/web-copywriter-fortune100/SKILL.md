# Fortune 100 Web Copywriter

Master conversion copywriting using proven techniques from legendary copywriters and Fortune 100 companies. This skill focuses on measurable results: clicks, conversions, and revenue.

## Core Philosophy

**"On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."** — David Ogilvy

Modern web copywriting is:
- **Conversion-focused**: Every word drives toward action
- **Customer-centric**: Written in the customer's language, not yours
- **Psychology-informed**: Leverages proven persuasion principles
- **Data-driven**: Testable, measurable, optimizable
- **Ethically persuasive**: Honest claims, authentic voice, customer benefit

## Quick Reference: Industry Focus

| Industry | Primary Goal | Key Metrics | Copy Approach |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **SaaS** | Trial signups, demos | Conversion rate, MRR | Problem-solution, feature-benefit, ROI calculator |
| **E-commerce** | Product purchases, AOV | Revenue, cart abandonment | Desire creation, urgency, social proof |
| **Digital Agency** | Lead generation, consultations | SQLs, consultation bookings | Authority, case studies, transformation stories |

# Part 1: Research & Strategy

## Step 1: Customer Language Mining (Joanna Wiebe Method)

**Critical Principle**: Use your customer's words, not marketing jargon.

### Research Sources (Priority Order)

1. **Customer Reviews** (Amazon, G2, Capterra, Trustpilot):
   - What problems do they mention?
   - What language do they use? (exact phrases)
   - What outcomes do they celebrate?
   - What objections appear repeatedly?

2. **Customer Support Conversations**:
   - Questions asked before purchase
   - Confusion points (need clarity in copy)
   - Complaints (address in objection handling)
   - Praise (use in testimonials)

3. **Sales Call Recordings**:
   - Pain points expressed
   - Hesitations before buying
   - Decision criteria mentioned
   - Language patterns (formal vs casual)

4. **Online Communities** (Reddit, Quora, niche forums):
   - How do they describe their problem?
   - What solutions have they tried?
   - What language do they use organically?

5. **Competitor Reviews**:
   - What do customers love? (gaps you can fill)
   - What do they hate? (opportunities)
   - What's missing? (unique positioning)

### The Mining Process

```
RESEARCH → EXTRACT → CATEGORIZE → PRIORITIZE → APPLY
    │         │           │            │          │
    │         │           │            │          └─ Write copy in customer voice
    │         │           │            └─ Rank by frequency + impact
    │         │           └─ Group: pains, desires, objections, outcomes
    │         └─ Pull exact phrases, verbatim quotes
    └─ Read 50-100 reviews, 20+ support tickets
```

**Example from SaaS Reviews**:
```
❌ Marketing speak: "Streamline your workflow"
✅ Customer language: "I can finally stop switching between 5 different tools"

❌ Generic: "Increase productivity"
✅ Customer language: "Saved me 10 hours a week—I leave work on time now"
```

## Step 2: The 5 Stages of Awareness (Eugene Schwartz)

**Critical Framework**: Match your copy to the customer's awareness level.

### Stage 1: Unaware
**State**: Doesn't know they have a problem
**Copy Focus**: Educate, reveal the problem
**Example**: "Why your Shopify store converts at 1% (and what to do about it)"

### Stage 2: Problem-Aware
**State**: Knows they have a problem, not aware of solutions
**Copy Focus**: Amplify the pain, introduce solution categories
**Example**: "Tired of manually following up with leads? There's a better way."

### Stage 3: Solution-Aware
**State**: Knows solutions exist, doesn't know YOUR solution
**Copy Focus**: Position your unique approach, differentiate
**Example**: "Unlike generic CRMs, [Product] was built specifically for agencies"

### Stage 4: Product-Aware
**State**: Knows your product exists, considering alternatives
**Copy Focus**: Comparison, proof, overcome objections
**Example**: "[Product] vs [Competitor]: Why 5,000 agencies switched"

### Stage 5: Most Aware
**State**: Ready to buy, needs final push
**Copy Focus**: Offer, urgency, remove friction
**Example**: "Start your 14-day free trial. No credit card required."

**Copywriting Implication**: Stage 1-2 need education, Stage 4-5 need conversion optimization.

## Step 3: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework

**Question**: "What job is the customer hiring your product to do?"

### The JTBD Template

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [outcome].
```

**Examples by Industry**:

**SaaS (Project Management)**:
- When my team is drowning in scattered tasks,
- I want to see everything in one place,
- So I can stop worrying if something's falling through the cracks.

**E-commerce (Fashion)**:
- When I need a professional outfit for work,
- I want to look put-together without spending hours shopping,
- So I can feel confident in meetings.

**Digital Agency (SEO Services)**:
- When my website isn't ranking,
- I want someone to fix it without technical jargon,
- So I can finally get clients finding me online.

**Use in Copy**: The "situation" becomes your hook, "motivation" becomes your messaging, "outcome" becomes your benefit.

# Part 3: Value Propositions & Messaging

## The Value Prop Formula (Conversion XL)

```
[End Result Customer Wants]
    +
[Specific Period of Time]
    +
[Address the Objections]
```

**Example (SaaS)**:
> "Get 30% more trial signups in 60 days—no code required, no designer needed"

- End result: 30% more trial signups
- Time: 60 days
- Objections: "I don't code" / "I can't afford a designer"

**Example (E-commerce)**:
> "Recover 15% of abandoned carts automatically—setup in 10 minutes, cancel anytime"

- End result: 15% recovery
- Time: Immediate (10 min setup)
- Objections: "Too complicated" / "What if I want to cancel?"

**Example (Agency)**:
> "Land 3 retainer clients in 90 days—even if you've never done outbound before"

- End result: 3 retainer clients
- Time: 90 days
- Objections: "I don't know how to do outbound"

---

## Messaging Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)

### Level 1: Headline (Primary Value Prop)
**Purpose**: Capture attention, communicate core benefit
**Length**: 5-12 words
**Example**: "Turn visitors into customers. Automatically."

### Level 2: Subheadline (Supporting Detail)

**Length**: 10-20 words
**Example**: "AI-powered email sequences that convert leads while you sleep. No coding required."

### Level 3: Supporting Points (3 Max)

**Length**: 3-5 short paragraphs

### Level 5: Call-to-Action (Clear Next Step)
**Purpose**: Remove friction, direct to specific action
**Example**: "Start Free Trial" (not "Learn More")

---

# Part 4: Conversion Copywriting Frameworks

## Framework 1: AIDA (Classic)

**A**ttention → **I**nterest → **D**esire → **A**ction

**Application (SaaS Landing Page)**:

**Attention** (Headline):
> "SaaS founders: Your onboarding is killing 70% of signups"

**Interest** (Problem Amplification):
> "Users sign up, log in once, and never come back. Not because your product is bad—because they're confused in the first 5 minutes."

**Desire** (Solution + Benefit):
> "ProductOnboard shows you exactly where users drop off and gives you proven templates to fix it. Companies using our framework see 3x more activation."

**Action** (CTA):
> "See Where You're Losing Users (Free 7-Day Trial)"

---

## Framework 2: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**P**roblem → **A**gitate → **S**olution

**Application (E-commerce Email)**:

**Problem**:
> "Your abandoned cart emails aren't working."

**Agitate**:
> "You're sending generic 'You left something behind' emails that get ignored. Meanwhile, $15K in potential revenue sits in abandoned carts every month. That's $180K a year you're leaving on the table."

**Solution**:
> "CartRecovery AI writes personalized cart emails based on what they almost bought, when they're most likely to open, and what discount (if any) it takes to convert them. Shopify stores using it recover 18% of abandoned carts (vs. 8% industry average)."

---

## Framework 3: FAB (Features → Advantages → Benefits)

**Application (Digital Agency Services)**:

**Feature**: "We provide monthly SEO reports"
**Advantage**: "You see exactly what's working and what's not"
**Benefit**: "You can justify the investment to your boss and keep the budget"

**Rule**: Always lead with benefits in headlines, use FAB in body copy.

---

## Framework 4: BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

**B**efore → **A**fter → **B**ridge

**Application (SaaS Homepage)**:

**Before** (Current frustration):
> "You're spending 10 hours a week manually following up with leads. Your inbox is chaos. Hot leads go cold because you forgot to reply."

**After** (Desired state):
> "Imagine every lead getting a personalized follow-up at exactly the right time—automatically. Your close rate doubles, and you spend those 10 hours actually talking to hot prospects, not managing spreadsheets."

**Bridge** (Your product):
> "[Product] automates your entire follow-up sequence. One-time setup, then it runs forever. Like having a full-time SDR for $99/month."

---

# Part 5: Persuasion Psychology (Cialdini's Principles)

## 1. Reciprocity

**Principle**: Give first, they give back

**Applications**:
- Free trial (SaaS): Give value upfront, they're more likely to convert
- Free shipping (E-commerce): Give something extra, increase conversion
- Free consultation (Agency): Give advice, they hire you

**Copy Example**:
> "Start your free trial. No credit card required, no strings attached."

---

## 2. Commitment & Consistency

**Principle**: Once someone commits (even small), they want to stay consistent

**Applications**:
- Multi-step forms (SaaS): Get name/email first, then ask for more
- Quiz funnels (E-commerce): Answer questions, then see results
- Content upgrades (Agency): Download guide, then book consultation

**Copy Example**:
> "Step 1 of 3: Tell us about your business" (feels easier than one big form)

---

## 3. Social Proof

**Principle**: People follow the crowd

**Types & Applications**:

**Customer Count**:
> "Join 47,000 SaaS founders using [Product]"

**Revenue/Results**:
> "Our customers generated $120M in revenue last year"

**Expert/Authority**:
> "Featured in Forbes, TechCrunch, and Inc."

**User Testimonials** (Most Powerful):
> "We went from 100 to 10,000 users in 6 months using [Product]" — Jane Doe, CEO of [Company]

**Ratings**:
> "4.9/5 stars from 1,200+ reviews on G2"

**Rule**: Specificity = credibility. "47,000" > "Thousands." "$120M" > "Millions."

---

## 4. Authority

**Principle**: We trust experts and credentials

**Applications**:
- Certifications: "SOC 2 certified, GDPR compliant"
- Team credentials: "Built by ex-Google engineers"
- Media mentions: "As featured in..."
- Awards: "Winner of 2025 Best SaaS Product"
- Case studies: "How [Big Brand] uses our product"

**Copy Example**:
> "Trusted by Nike, Shopify, and 5,000+ brands worldwide"

---

## 5. Liking

**Principle**: We buy from people we like

**Applications**:
- Founder story: Show human side, relatability
- Friendly tone: "Hey" not "Dear Valued Customer"
- Humor: When appropriate for brand
- Shared values: "Built by bootstrapped founders for bootstrapped founders"

**Copy Example**:
> "We're a small team that got tired of bloated, overpriced software. So we built something simple that just works."

---

## 6. Scarcity

**Principle**: We want what's limited or running out

**Types**:

**Limited Time**:
> "Offer ends Friday at midnight"

**Limited Quantity**:
> "Only 5 spots left for this month"

**Limited Access**:
> "Early access for the first 100 signups"

**⚠️ Ethical Rule**: NEVER fake scarcity. If it's not real, don't claim it.

---

## 7. Unity

**Principle**: We trust "our people" (shared identity)

**Applications**:
- Industry-specific: "Built for e-commerce founders by e-commerce founders"
- Geographic: "Proudly Australian-made"
- Value-based: "For founders who care about privacy"

**Copy Example**:
> "Made by agency owners who've been exactly where you are"

---

# Part 6: Landing Page Structure

### 3. Features/Benefits Section

Show the right message to the right person
at the right time. Conversions go up 3x.

```

   Pick from 50+ proven high-converting templates.

3. Launch & Optimize (Ongoing)
   Go live, then A/B test to improve conversions.
```

---

### 5. Objection Handling Section

**Address the top 3-5 objections**:

**Objection**: "Is it hard to set up?"
**Answer**: "Most customers are live in under 10 minutes. Plus, we have 24/7 live chat if you get stuck."

**Objection**: "What if I need to cancel?"
**Answer**: "Cancel anytime with one click. No contracts, no hassle."

**Objection**: "Does it integrate with [tool]?"
**Answer**: "We integrate with 100+ tools including Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, and Zapier."

---

### 6. Pricing Section (If Applicable)

**Best Practices**:
- Show 3 tiers (most pick middle)
- Highlight recommended plan
- Annual discount (e.g., "Save 20%")
- Feature comparison table
- Money-back guarantee

**Example**:
```
[Starter] $49/mo
For solo founders

[Growth] $99/mo ← MOST POPULAR
For growing teams

[Enterprise] Custom
For large organizations

→ 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee
```

---

### 7. Final CTA (High-Contrast)

**Components**:
- Benefit-driven CTA button (not "Submit")
- Risk reversal (e.g., "No credit card required")
- One last objection handled

**Example**:
```
[Large Button] Start Your Free 14-Day Trial →

No credit card required. Cancel anytime.
Join 12,000+ companies growing with [Product].
```
