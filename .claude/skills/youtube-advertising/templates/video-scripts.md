## Script Writing Tips

### The Read-Aloud Test
```
Always read scripts aloud.
Time yourself.
If it feels rushed, cut words.
If there's dead air, you have room.
```

### Words-Per-Second Guide
```
Casual pace: 2-2.5 words/second
Normal pace: 2.5-3 words/second
Fast pace: 3-3.5 words/second

15 sec = 38-52 words
30 sec = 75-105 words
60 sec = 150-210 words
```

### Punctuation = Pacing
```
. = Full stop (brief pause)
, = Breath (micro pause)
— = Dramatic pause
... = Trailing off
! = Energy boost
? = Inflection up
```

### Writing for Ear, Not Eye
```
❌ Written: "Utilize our proprietary technology"
✅ Spoken: "Use our tech"

❌ Written: "Approximately 50 percent"
✅ Spoken: "About half"

❌ Written: "Do not hesitate to contact us"
✅ Spoken: "Reach out anytime"
```
